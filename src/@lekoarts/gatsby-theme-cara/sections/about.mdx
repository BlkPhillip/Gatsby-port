## About

> Hello there! I'm a Full Stack Web Developer who has recently completed a one-year course in web development. Now, I'm on the lookout for job opportunities that will allow me to put my skills to the test in a dynamic and collaborative environment.

I'm a creative enthusiast with a diverse educational background in arts and multimedia. My passion lies in the realm of creation, whether it's through designing multimedia projects, crafting music on my bass guitar, or immersing in the world of modular synthesizers. When I'm not crafting digital art or music, you'll often find me behind the turntables, mixing vinyl records and sharing my love for music with others as a DJ.
